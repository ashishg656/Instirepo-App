Instirepo - 'Student Teacher Interaction'
Instirepo is a platform where students and teachers can share notes, knowledge, news, announcements, assignments, images or any content with each other. They can select the audience for every post - i.e whether they want their post to be visible to selected batches, branches, academic years or selected professors. They can save their choices of these visibilities for quick access later. Hence all college related data is available at a dedicated, secure place which makes it easy to keep track of all college content. They can also chat with other users. The posts can be upvoted, downvoted, followed (to get notifications) , reported as spam, commented, saved as favorite. Also, users who have viewed a particular post are also visible for each post.
While uploading post, user can choose category among events, polls or general posts and based on the category selected, corresponding layout is shown.
Also, there is a ecommerce part in this application, where users can upload products that they want to sell and then other users can contact them through the app ir they want to purchase that product.
Complete application can be run offline(if data available in cache i.e viewed at least once).
